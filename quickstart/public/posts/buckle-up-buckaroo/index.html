  <h1>Buckle Up, Buckaroo</h1>

  <p>Exciting! <a href="https://twitter.com/bradyocallahan">Brady O’Callahan</a> invited me to create a mixtape for June 2023. Here’s the result and a clip from his newsletter:</p>
<h2 id="_buckle-up-buckaroo_"><strong><em>Buckle Up, Buckaroo</em></strong></h2>
<p>**_I just got to spend a long weekend in Cleveland and I feel pretty rejuvenated. The midwest is absolutely gorgeous in the summer, and I haven&rsquo;t seen Cleveland like that in over a decade. There are few things better than driving around with the windows down on a beautiful day, listening to some good tunes.</p>
<p>And folks, this month&rsquo;s mixtape, a collab with my buddy Pat, is exceptional driving music. Though we&rsquo;re both enormous fans and advocates for Brazilian tunes, Pat hit me up with a desire to explore country. Readers, I was thrilled. This one&rsquo;s got some all-timers, deep cuts, and new favs.</p>
<p>Like the mixtapes? Help me spread the love by throwing a few bucks my way via_** <a href="https://twitter.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=92e1a78de4b0cd7e307d2c6ba&amp;id=c2f21814d5&amp;e=584320c176"><strong><em>BuyMeACoffee</em></strong></a>**_. Thanks to everyone who has already supported me there. This really helps me not rack up a stupid amount of debt while making this passion project for you all.</p>

A few words from Pat:_</strong></p>
<p>Being from the NYC suburbs, country was never really a &ldquo;thing.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t name a Garth Brooks song, just that he had an alter-ego. I only knew who Roy Rogers was because of a fast-food restaurant. Country as a whole, not just a pop culture thing people liked to dunk on, only popped up on road trips when our local FM stations faded to static.</p>
<p>For me, Country music became synonymous with rolling through Georgia at sunset because you&rsquo;re stuck in traffic, but maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad because you&rsquo;re singing along to new-to-you old songs. Music is one of my favorite ways to explore people and places, so why not learn about the genre by making a road trip playlist?</p>
<p>This is a playlist of songs for big skies and roads you&rsquo;ve never driven down. It&rsquo;s also about moving on and getting past the shit.</p>
<p>A negligent landlord and a burglary (everyone&rsquo;s okay!!!) made these lyrics almost autobiographical - &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stay, but I might have to go to start over again&rdquo; and &ldquo;I need this shit like I need another hole in my head.&rdquo; The honesty, twang of the guitars, and self-deprecating humor is cathartic. During our move, I joked &ldquo;I&rsquo;m paying these guys when someone just took all my stuff for free.&rdquo; Yeah, things aren&rsquo;t great, but that&rsquo;s not gonna stop me.</p>
<p>What started as a way to &ldquo;just find some new songs&rdquo; was heavily influenced by a move to a new home to a new town in a new state. It&rsquo;s all about the new stuff, even if it&rsquo;s old. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to blow up your tv, hit the road, and see what&rsquo;s out there.</p>

<p><strong><em>(that you might love too!)</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=92e1a78de4b0cd7e307d2c6ba&amp;id=e6d5fac528&amp;e=584320c176">Fonts In Use</a> - I really love this site. As the name suggests, it&rsquo;s a site that documents fonts for everything from album art to brand identities. Click on a font to see a collection of images using that font! I knew I wanted a Western look for the playlist image, so I scoured this site until I came across <a href="https://twitter.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=92e1a78de4b0cd7e307d2c6ba&amp;id=35fe80fe2a&amp;e=584320c176">Cowboy Slang</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=92e1a78de4b0cd7e307d2c6ba&amp;id=02fb7bbeaa&amp;e=584320c176">Eliminadorzinho&rsquo;s Rock Jr.</a> - A few years ago, I went to Brazil and went to a shoegaze show. Eliminadorzinho (Little Eliminator) were listed as &ldquo;thrash shoegaze&rdquo; and Rock Jr. sells me on that description. It&rsquo;s an energetic ball of controlled chaos that ends on a song about Tony Hawk&rsquo;s Pro Skater.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=92e1a78de4b0cd7e307d2c6ba&amp;id=95576d9783&amp;e=584320c176">Trrpln&rsquo;s Olhar Pra Trás</a> - Terraplana also played and just released their first album Olhar Pra Trás (Look Back). It&rsquo;s beautiful and reminds me of how immense a Mogwai album can sound. I bought a shirt from them, and a cab driver, not knowing it was a band, checked in to make sure I knew it meant &ldquo;Flat Earth&rdquo; and that I hadn&rsquo;t been duped.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=92e1a78de4b0cd7e307d2c6ba&amp;id=5efde7fc66&amp;e=584320c176">Adorável Clichê&rsquo;s Gelo Fino</a> - Notice the trend yet? Adorável Clichê closed out the show with dreamy songs to a crowd in a big group embrace, singing the roof off of the venue. Gelo Fino is a newer single, and I&rsquo;ve got my fingers crossed there&rsquo;s an album coming soon. Their songs are beautiful, and their CD has lived in my player since I got it.</p>
